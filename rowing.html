      <h2>Rowing</h2>
      <p>
        As a Paralympic rower, I’ve had the honor of representing my country
        internationally. My proudest achievement is winning a bronze medal in
        the PR3 Mix2x category at Paris 2024. I've also earned numerous other
        national and international medals.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learnt to row while studying at the University of Cambridge. After
        initially training with Trinity Hall Boat Club, I joined the Cambridge
        University Boat Clubs Lightweight Rowing program, and subsequently the
        German National Team. Since my debut at the World Championships 2018 in
        Plovdiv, Bulgaria, I have competed in numerous international events,
        including the European Championships and the World Championships, across
        several boat classes, both sweeping and sculling.
      </p>

        In addition to the above, I also hold a number of medals from the World
        Rowing Cup series, German Championship titles in the single, double,
        pair, and four (All PR3), and I raced the spare pair in the 2019
        Lightweight Boat Race between Oxford & Cambridge.
      </p>

      <h2>Awards</h2>
      <p>
        My athletic achievements have been recognised by a number of awards. In
        2020, I was awarded a Full Blue by the University of Cambridge in the
        sport of rowing. My team (PR3 Mix4+) was elected Paralympic Team of the
        Year in 2022 and has been nominated for the same award in 2023 (PR3
        Mix4+) and 2024 (PR3 Mix2x). I was also awarded the Silver Laurel Leaf
        in 2024 which marks the highest honour for athletic achievements
        bestowed by the German state.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been supported by the Sportstiftung NRW, Birgit & Thomas Rabe
        Stiftung, and since 2023 I have joined the Deutsche Sporthilfe in their
        Paralympics Team.
