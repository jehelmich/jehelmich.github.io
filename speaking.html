      <p>
        I am available for speaking engagements on topics including sport,
        research, dual careers, and inclusion. Reach out if you're interested in
        having me speak at your event, workshop, or panel.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience includes the insurance, medical, and telecommunications
        fields. Notable clients are Allianz, Axa, and the Hartmann group. In
        addition, I had speaker appointments for various charitable
        organisations and schools.
      </p>

      <p>
        The talks are tailored to the audience, ranging from small group
        sessions to large panel discussions, and can be delivered in English or
        German. I am also open to virtual events. If you'd like more
        information, please reach out directly to me!
